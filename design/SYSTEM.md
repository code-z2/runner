## 2026-11-05 — Order-of-operations spec (items 1–11)

- Item: design/ORDER.md agreed sequence + per-item specs
- What it is: discussion-first specs for F01/F02/F03/F11, encounters, PacePilot coach, merchants, treasury 2-of-N, wallet stack (Apple + NEAR), goal-lock escrow, platform defaults
- How it was done: one-feature-at-a-time discussion, appended only as agreed, no UI
- Why this way: AGENT.md discuss-then-build; keeps fitness core independent of money paths
- Importance: build sequence source of truth; product.md remains concept inventory
- Metadata: design/ORDER.md, design/product.md; 2026-11-05

## 2026-11-07 — Step-1 scaffold

- Item: foundations scaffold (packages, apps/ios shell, apps/api stub, hook)
- What it is: 10 flat SwiftPM packages with namespace shells, hand-written
  Runner.xcodeproj (Debug/Staging/Beta/Release), App shell, zero-dep Bun api
  stub, pre-push format:check hook
- How it was done: research-first (wades-app layout, AppEnvironment pattern),
  built step by step, audited against swift-coding-guideline, verified by build
- Why this way: auditable single-responsibility boxes, no UI, flat packages
  without swift-java plumbing
- Importance: ground all later package steps stand on
- Metadata: packages/Runner*, apps/ios, apps/api, tools/git-hooks/pre-push; 2026-11-07
